# Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

A **path**   in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path.


**Example 1**:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2**:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```

**Solution**:

Use dfs calculate the max sum of lower nodes first then upper

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        res = root.val
        
        def dfs(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
            nonlocal res
            if not root:
                return 0
            
            left = max(dfs(root.left), 0)
            right = max(dfs(root.right), 0)
            
            total = left + right + root.val
            
            res = max(res, total)
            
            return max(left, right) + root.val
        
        dfs(root)
        return res
```
