# K Closest Points to Origin

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

**Example 1**:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/closestplane1.jpg)

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
```

**Solution**:

```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        pts = []
        for x, y in points:
            dist = (abs(x - 0) ** 2) + (abs(y - 0) ** 2) # using this formula increases performance
            pts.append([dist, x, y])

        res = []
        heapq.heapify(pts)
        for i in range(k):
            dist, x, y = heapq.heappop(pts)
            res.append([x, y])
        return res
```
